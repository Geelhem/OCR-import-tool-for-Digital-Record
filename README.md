**The reop is part of Guernsey French Language Preservation Project**
**Overview**
The Guernsey French Language Preservation Project aims to digitize and preserve resources related to the endangered Guernsey French Language. By creating a digital record, we ensure that valuable texts, documents, and cultural heritage are accessible to future generations.

**Goals and Objectives**

Preservation: Digitize Guernsey French Language resources, including PDFs and images. 

The program for Priority 2 will need to be able to import data program should run Tikka and Tesseract from pdfs and common image files into the digital record of existing written work.
    a.The code should be optimised, so it can ingest documents from a directory be post processed so that the scanned documents in pdf or image are not at outputting gibberish and inform the user if the quality is not good enough. The process will be automated or promt the user for verification
    b.Data Extracted from the images and PDFs that should be converted to text file and output organised, so that files names indicate whether the content of the files is in English (containing "eng" before the file extention) or the target language containing "gf" before the file extention)
    C.One part of this program should also allow The user to provide a web link that will scrape the website for the contents and include it in to the digital library, separating the sections in English and In the target language.
    D.the digital library of bilingual texts should be accessible via the UI, The same text should be available, side-by-side on one side in English, and on one side in the target language

**Community Access:** Make the digital records available to the Guernsey French language-speaking community and researchers.

Raise Awareness: Highlight the importance of language preservation.
